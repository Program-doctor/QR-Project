# QR Project
First Frontend Mentor Project

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Back to Frontend Development â€“ Promise Sylvester

After spending the past year immersed in AI training, NLP models, and LLM experimentation, my frontend skills took a quiet backseat... and my GitHub? Letâ€™s just say it enjoyed a long nap.

But that changes now.

Iâ€™ve recently joined the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) program to rebuild my frontend muscleâ€”one real-world project at a time. This repo is the first step in my journey back: no fluff, no egoâ€”just clean, modern frontend challenges that sharpen my skills and expand my portfolio.

### Why this matters:
- ðŸ§  Rewiring my brain from AI prompts to HTML/CSS grids  
- ðŸ’ª Rebuilding consistency through challenge-based learning  
- ðŸ§° Refamiliarizing myself with best practices and UI fundamentals  

Whether you're here to learn, give feedback, or track my progressâ€”welcome! Letâ€™s get better, build things, and ship work that speaks for itself.

# QR Code Component

This is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor QR Code Component Challenge](). The goal was to build a simple and responsive card component that features a QR code, styled layout and accessible HTML structure.

##  Overview

This is a beginner-level frontend project that helped me:

- Rebuild my confidence in HTML and CSS after a break focused on AI.
- Reinforce the use of semantic tags (I strictly made used of semantic tags only since it is not a large project).
- Practice layout centering using Flexbox
- Create a clean, mobile-friendly component with scalable typography and spacing
- Use responsive design techniques (media queries and rem units)

##  Tech Used

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- Media Queries for responsiveness
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

##  What I had to relearn

- How to use `display: flex` to center content both vertically and horizontally
- The importance of mobile-first design with max-widths and scalable font units
- Structuring a proper README to communicate the project clearly
- Clean folder and file setup for a real-world dev project

##  Future Improvements
- Deploy with GitHub Pages or Netlify
- Feel free to give feedback or follow my progress as I build more projects from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvester-promise-queen-of-ai-7492a5247)!

## Continued Development

- I plan to continue improving my use of media queries to handle more complex responsive layouts and better support a wider range of screen sizes.


Stay tuned, more projects coming soon.
